# NLPWash
A library to clean textual data. The features of NLPWash is its flexibility. Different projects may have different requirements so this library is designed the to allow users to clean data based on their requirements. 
Imagine a scenario where we're tasked with sentiment analysis. The library's interface allows us to decide whether to retain or discard emojis , and even select our preferred stemming approach. This level of control enables users to iterate through different configurations, helping them fine-tune the preprocessing process for optimal analysis outcomes.
